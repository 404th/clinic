## _"Clinic" test application_

Prerequisite:

## Public repo: [Clinic](https://github.com/404th/clinic) on GitHub.

## Running application after cloning it.

After cloning, global environment file ```.env``` must be created and example environments from ```.env.example``` are copied and pasted to ```.env```
```
cd clinic
```
```
touch .env
```
```
go mod tidy
```

Then, database should be created in docker container. To build db in container built-in commands are written in Makefile. We should run the command step-by-step:

```
make swag-init
```
```
make psqlcontainer
```
```
make createdb
```
Now, we successfully run container and created database =)

```
make start
```
